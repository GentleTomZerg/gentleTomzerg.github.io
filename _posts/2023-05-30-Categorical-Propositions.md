# Four Kinds of Categorical Propostions
## A: Universal Affirmative Propostions
<center> All S is P </center>

## E: Universal Negative Propostions
<center> No S is P </center>

## I: Paticular Affirmative Propostions
<center> Some S is P </center>

## O: Paticular Negative Propostions
<center> Some S is not P </center>

# Quality, Quantity and Distribution
## Quality
- Affirmative(A, I): the propostions affirms some class inclusion, whether complete or
  partial.
- Negative(E, O): the propostions denies some class inclusion, whether complete or
  partial.

## Quantity
- Universal(A, E): the propostions refers to `all members` of the class as its subjects.
- Paticular(I, O): the propostions refers only to `some members` of the class designated
  by its subject.

## General Schema
<center>Quantifier + Subject + Copula + Predicate</center>

## Distribution
A propostion distributes a term if it refers to `all members` of the class
designated by that term.

- the **quantity** of any standard-form Categorical Propostion **determines** whether
  its **subject term** is distributed or undistributed.
- the **quality** of any standard-form Categorical Propostion **determines** whether
  its **predicate term** is distributed or undistributed.

| |Predicate term undistributed|Predicate term distributed|
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
|**Subject term distributed**|A: All S is P|E: No S is P|
|**Subject term undistributed**|I: Some S is P|O: Some S is not P|

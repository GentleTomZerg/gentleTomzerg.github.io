# Syllogistic Arguments

Daily language has three kinds of **deviations**

- First deviation: The premises and conclusion of an argument in ordinary
  language may appear in an order that is **not the order** of the standard-form
  syllogism.

- Second deviation: The premises of an argument in ordinary language may appear
  to involve **more than three terms**, but can be reduced to three without loss
  of meaning.

- Third deviation: The component propositions of a syllogistic argument in
  ordinary language may not all be standard-form propositions.

# Translating Categorical Propositions into Standard Form

## :star: Singular Propositions

Propositions affirm or deny that a specific individual or object belongs to a
given class.

```tex
Socrates is a philosopher.
This table is not an antique.
```

- To every individual object there corresponds a unique **unit class**(one
  membered class) whose only member is that object itself.

- So, we can say $\text{S is P}$ is logically equivalent to $\text{All S is P}$

- However, **Singular Propositions** have more meanings. If we just translate it
  to A or E proposition, the existential import of $\text{S is P}$ is omitted.

- :star: Therefore, an affirmative proposition is equivalent to the **conjunction** of
  the related **A and I** categorical proposition. A negative one is equivalent
  to the conjunction of **E and O**.

  ```tex
  S is P == All S is P and Some S is P
  S is not P == No S is P and Some S is not P
  ```

- In this way, the **distribution** and **existential import** of Singular
  Propositions are fulfilled.

## Categorical Propositions That have Adjectives or Adjectival Phrases as Predicates, Rather than Substantives or Class Terms.

```tex
Some flowers are beautiful.
No warships are available for active duty.

Some flowers are beautiful things.
No warships are things available for active duty
```

## Categorical Propositions Whose Main Verbs Are Other than the Standard-Form Copula "To Be"

```tex
All people seek recogniton.
Some people drink Greek wine.

All people are seekers fo recogniton.
Some people are Greek-wine drinkers
```

## Statements in Which the Standard-Form Ingredients Are All Present But Not Arranged in Standard-Form Order

```tex
Racehorses are all thoroughbreds.
All is well that ends well.

All Racehorses are thoroughbreds.
All things that ends well are things that are well.
```
